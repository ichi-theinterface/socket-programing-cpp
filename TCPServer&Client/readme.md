**Why Messages Can Be Seen as Plain Text on the Network:**
If encryption is not used, data transmitted over a network, including messages, can be intercepted and read as plain text by anyone with the necessary tools and access to the network. This is why it's crucial to use encryption techniques, like SSL/TLS, especially for sensitive data, to ensure the data is scrambled and can only be read by the intended recipient.
